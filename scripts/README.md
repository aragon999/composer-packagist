# Collection of helper scripts
Due to the lightweight API, there are of course tasks which require a lot of unnecessary work, therefore here is a collection of scripts I use.

Feel free to create your own scripts, and if they are helpful for others you can create a pull request adding them. Note I will only accept `bash`-scripts which contain `set -euo pipefail`.
